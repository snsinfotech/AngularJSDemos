<!--  
AngularJS directives are used to extend HTML. 
These are special attributes starting with ng- prefix. 
We're going to discuss following directives −

ng-app − This directive starts an AngularJS Application.
		ng-app directive starts an AngularJS Application. 
		It defines the root element. It automatically initializes or 
		bootstraps the application when web page containing AngularJS 
		Application is loaded. It is also used to load various AngularJS 
		modules in AngularJS Application. In this example, 
		we have defined a default AngularJS application 
		using ng-app attribute of a div element.
ng-init − This directive initializes application data.

ng-model − This directive defines the model that is variable 
	to be used in AngularJS.

ng-repeat − This directive repeats html elements for 
	each item in a collection.
